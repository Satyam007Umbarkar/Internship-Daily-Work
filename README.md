# Internship-Daily-Work


DAY 1 – 01 Jan 2026 

On the first day of internship, I received orientation from the company mentor.Internship
rules, work discipline, reporting structure, and expectations were explained.
I was introduced to the company’s working domain and future project areas.
Basic guidance was given about learning Python programming as the initial task.








DAY 2 – 02 Jan 2026

In this phase From Today,I started learning Python programming as it was given as a
pre-requisite condition by the company Newtech Systems.
I first installed Python and the required software tools on my system. 
After completing the IDE setup and testing the environment configuration, I learned 
how to run Python programs and understand the basic execution flow. I then focused on core 
concepts such as syntax, variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and functions. 
The mentor verified my setup and assigned basic practice tasks to strengthen my fundamentals.
